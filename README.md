## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-and-algorithms-java.git
cd data-structures-and-algorithms-java/src/main/java
text

## Usage

To compile and run the Java files:

1. Navigate to the `src/main/java` directory.
2. Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

java algorithms.SortingAlgorithms
text

## Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes linked together.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

Refer to the [data_structures.md](docs/data_structures.md) for detailed documentation.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  
- **Searching Algorithms**:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

Refer to the [algorithms.md](docs/algorithms.md) for detailed documentation.
